        <h3>Nature, derived from the Latin word natura, for "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, this literally referred to "birth"; in a broader sense, it has been applied to the entire physical or material world, and in some mystical or metaphysical uses to realms of relationships beyond these. Natura was a Latin translation of the Greek word φύσις (physis), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord. "Nature" or "the natural world" usually refers to the phenomena of the physical world, including the processes and states of life within it, in ranges of scale from the subatomic to the cosmic. The concepts of nature as a whole being equivalent to the physical universe and its observed or observable processes involves both expansions and contractions of the original notions; such began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers, and have steadily gained currency ever since, with such usage firmly established during the advent of modern scientific methods in the last several centuries.</h3>
