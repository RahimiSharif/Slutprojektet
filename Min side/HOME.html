            <h2>Ice Hockey</h2>
            <p>Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use
                their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. The sport is
                known to be fast-paced and physical, with teams usually consisting of six players each: one goaltender,
                and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the
                opposing team.<br><br>

                Ice hockey is most popular in Canada, central and eastern Europe, the Nordic countries, Russia and the
                United States. Ice hockey is the official national winter sport of Canada. In addition, ice hockey is
                the most popular winter sport in Belarus, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, Latvia, Russia,
                Slovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland. North America's National Hockey League (NHL) is the highest level for
                men's ice hockey and the strongest professional ice hockey league in the world. The Kontinental Hockey
                League (KHL) is the highest league in Russia and much of Eastern Europe. The International Ice Hockey
                Federation (IIHF) is the formal governing body for international ice hockey, with the IIHF managing
                international tournaments and maintaining the IIHF World Ranking. Worldwide, there are ice hockey
                federations in 76 countries.<br><br>

                In Canada, the United States, Nordic countries, and some other European countries the sport is known
                simply as hockey; the name "ice hockey" is used in places where "hockey" more often refers to the more
                popular field hockey, such as countries in South America, Asia, Africa, Australasia, and some European
                countries including the United Kingdom, Ireland and the Netherlands. Ice hockey is believed to have
                evolved from simple stick and ball games played in the 18th and 19th century the United Kingdom and
                elsewhere. These games were brought to North America and several similar winter games using informal
                rules as they were developed, such as shinny and ice polo. The contemporary sport of ice hockey was
                developed in Canada, most notably in Montreal, where the first indoor hockey game was played on March 3,
                1875. Some characteristics of that game, such as the length of the ice rink and the use of a puck, have
                been retained to this day. Amateur ice hockey leagues began in the 1880s, and professional ice hockey
                originated around 1900. The Stanley Cup, emblematic of ice hockey club supremacy, was first awarded in
                1893 to recognize the Canadian amateur champion and later became the championship trophy of the NHL. In
                the early 1900s, the Canadian rules were adopted by the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace, the
                precursor of the IIHF and the sport was played for the first time at the Olympics during the 1920 Summer
                Olympics.<br><br>

                In international competitions, the national teams of six countries (the Big Six) predominate: Canada,
                Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, Sweden and the United States. Of the 69 medals awarded all-time in
                men's competition at the Olympics, only seven medals were not awarded to one of those countries (or two
                of their precursors, the Soviet Union for Russia, and Czechoslovakia for the Czech Republic). In the
                annual Ice Hockey World Championships, 177 of 201 medals have been awarded to the six nations. Teams
                outside the Big Six have won only five medals in either competition since 1953. The World Cup of Hockey
                is organized by the National Hockey League and the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA),
                unlike the annual World Championships and quadrennial Olympic tournament, both run by the International
                Ice Hockey Federation. World Cup games are played under NHL rules and not those of the IIHF, and the
                tournament occurs prior to the NHL pre-season, allowing for all NHL players to be available, unlike the
                World Championships, which overlaps with the NHL's Stanley Cup playoffs. Furthermore, all 12 Women's
                Olympic and 36 IIHF World Women's Championships medals were awarded to one of these six countries. The
                Canadian national team or the United States national team have between them won every gold medal of
                either series.</p>
