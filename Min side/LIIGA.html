            <h2>Finnish Elite League</h2>
            <p>The SM-liiga (marketed as just Liiga from 2013 on), colloquially called the Finnish Elite League in
                English, is the top professional ice hockey league in Finland. It is one of the six founding leagues of
                the Champions Hockey League and currently allocated five spots - the maximum number - based on success
                in previous editions. It was created in 1975 to replace the SM-sarja, which was fundamentally an amateur
                league. The SM-liiga is not directly overseen by the Finnish Ice Hockey Association, but the league and
                association have an agreement of cooperation. SM is a common abbreviation for Suomen mestaruus, "Finnish
                championship".<br><br>

                The SM-liiga formerly had a system of automatic promotion and relegation in place between itself and the
                Mestis, the second highest level of competition in Finland, but the automatic system was ended in 2000.
                The league was opened in 2005 and allowed KalPa to get a promotion. In 2009, a new system was introduced
                and it includes the last placed SM-liiga team facing the Mestis champion in a best of seven playout
                series. In 2013, the relegation system was abandoned again and replaced by a procedure in which
                successful clubs of Mestis may apply for a promotion if they fulfill definite financial criteria. Since
                2013, Jokerit joined the KHL and Espoo Blues went bankrupt, but Sport, KooKoo and Jukurit were promoted.
                Therefore Liiga is a competition of 15 teams in the 2016–17 and 2017–18 seasons.
                The SM-liiga was constituted in 1975 to concentrate the development of top-level Finnish ice hockey, and
                pave the way towards professionalism. Its predecessor, the SM-sarja, being an amateur competition, had
                its disadvantages, which were perceived as impeding Finland's rise to the highest ranks of ice
                hockey.<br><br>

                One of the main problems was that the governing of the SM-sarja was based on the annual meeting of the
                Finnish Ice Hockey Association, where all important issues were decided by vote. Since all clubs
                registered under the Finnish Ice Hockey Association had the right to vote, the many amateur clubs
                prevailed over the few business-like clubs. Therefore, the concentrated development of top-level Finnish
                ice hockey by the motivated and financially capable clubs proved arduous. The new SM-liiga was to be run
                by a board consisting of its participating clubs only and to have an agreement of cooperation with the
                Finnish Ice Hockey Association.<br><br>

                The SM-sarja was also outdated on its own, as it was run according to amateur principles. Clubs were not
                supposed to pay their players beyond compensation for lost wages. However, by the 1970s many clubs were
                already run like businesses and recruited players through a contract of employment, paying their wages
                secretly and often evading taxes. However, in 1974, accounting reform in Finland extended book-keeping
                standards to cover sports clubs, and shortfalls were exposed in audit raids. The SM-liiga was to allow
                wages for players, and clubs were also put under a tighter supervision. They were to establish their own
                association for SM-liiga ice hockey only, separating their commitments from junior activities and other
                sports. Copies of all player contracts were to be sent to the SM-liiga to provide players with adequate
                security, such as insurance and pensions.<br><br>

                The SM-sarja had other limits for players. According to amateur ideals, no player could represent more
                than one club within one season. Personal sponsorship was also forbidden. To discourage trading, a
                system of quarantine was in force. The SM-liiga stripped the limitations for players, replaced
                quarantine with a then-modest transfer payment, and introduced the transfer list. Players wanting a
                transfer were to sign up, and the SM-liiga would distribute the right of negotiations to clubs. In
                practice, the list was not successful, as both parties often worked their way around the
                formalities.<br><br>

                These changes led to a transition towards professional ice hockey as the league became
                semi-professional. Only a few players would make a livelihood out of ice hockey in Finland in the 1970s,
                and many players, especially the young, would settle for a contract in the SM-liiga without a
                wage.<br><br>

                A major financial development for professional ice hockey in Finland was the introduction of playoffs.
                Gate receipts and other income from playoffs were pooled and distributed as a placement bonus. Although
                playoffs were the standard way of determining the champions in North American professional sports, at
                the time they were not common in Europe.<br><br>

                The SM-liiga was established rather hastily. The required changes were initiated at the 1974 annual
                meeting, and the SM-liiga was launched for the 1975–76 season. It was the first Finnish professional
                sports league, and its solutions were untried. However, there had been a mounting demand for these
                changes, as the popularity of ice hockey had been rising in the previous decade.<br><br>

                The SM-liiga picked up where the SM-sarja left off with its 10 clubs. The four best of the regular
                season were to proceed to the playoffs. The system of promotion and relegation from the SM-sarja
                remained in force: last-placed teams of the regular season had to qualify for their position in the
                SM-liiga against the best teams of the second-highest series.<br><br>

                The combined attendance for the first eleven regular seasons hovered around 900,000. In 1986–87, the
                number of games for each team was increased from 36 to 44, reaching its current level of 56 games in
                2000–01, and the SM-liiga was expanded to 12 clubs for the 1988–89 season. The general popularity of ice
                hockey strengthened through international success of the Finland men's national ice hockey team, and the
                combined attendance climbed through the 1990s to about 1.8 million. This prompted an increase in the
                profitability of the ice hockey business and the completion of the transition to full professionalism.
                By the mid-1990s, all players were full-time, and by 2000, most clubs had reformed into limited
                companies. In late 1990s and early 2000s the SM-liiga was the strongest hockey league in Europe and the
                second strongest in the world. By that time many Finnish, Czech and North American players made their
                professional breakthroughs in Finland. Particularly HIFK, Jokerit and TPS had many former and future NHL
                players in their rosters during the 1990s and early 2000s.<br><br>

                Since the 2000–01 season, the SM-liiga has been closed, meaning that relegations and promotions take
                place only by the judgment of the board of the SM-liiga. The only such promotion took place instantly in
                2000. Without the threat of relegation, the weaker clubs were supposed to be able to recuperate and
                improve. This had, however, a side effect: clubs with a losing record that had lost their hopes of
                reaching the playoffs often disposed of high-salary star players, letting down their supporters. To
                counteract this, the playoffs were expanded to the best 10 clubs each season from among the 13 total in
                the league.<br><br>

                The league changed its name to just Liiga for the 2013–14 season, and introduced a new logo to
                match.<br><br>

                Today, there are 15 teams in the league. Nowadays the SM-liiga is considered one of the strongest
                leagues in Europe alongside with the SHL and behind the KHL.</p>
