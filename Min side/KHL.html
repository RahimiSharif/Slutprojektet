            <h2>Kontinental Hockey League</h2>
            <p>The Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) (Russian: Континентальная хоккейная лига (КХЛ), Kontinental'naya
                hokkeynaya liga) is an international professional ice hockey league founded in 2008. It comprises 25
                member clubs based in Belarus, China, Finland, Latvia, Kazakhstan and Russia, and it is planned to
                expand to more countries. It is widely considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in
                Europe and Asia, and second in the world behind the National Hockey League. KHL has the third
                highest average attendance in Europe with 6,121 spectators per game in the regular season, and the
                highest total attendance in Europe with 5.32 million spectators in the regular season.<br><br>

                The Gagarin Cup is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season. The title
                of Champion of Russia is given to the highest ranked Russian team.The league formed from the Russian
                Superleague (RSL) and the champion of the 2007–08 season of the second division, with 24 teams: 21 from
                Russia and one each from Belarus, Latvia, and Kazakhstan. The teams were divided into four divisions,
                based on the performance in previous seasons.[citation needed]<br><br>

                The start of the fourth season was overshadowed by the Yaroslavl air disaster on 7 September 2011 in
                which almost all members of the team Lokomotiv Yaroslavl lost their lives shortly after take-off for
                their flight to their season opening game in Minsk. The Opening Cup game in Ufa, which was already under
                way when news of the disaster arrived, was suspended. In memory of the disaster, 7 September remains a
                day of mourning on which no KHL regular season games are held.<br><br>

                In the 2009–10 season, Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg joined the KHL and Khimik Voskresensk was transferred
                to a lower league. Next season, Yugra Khanty-Mansiysk joined the league.<br><br>

                After several attempts by teams from Central Europe and Scandinavia to join the KHL, expansion beyond
                the borders of the former Soviet Union was finally realized in 2011. Lev Poprad, a newly founded team
                based in Poprad, Slovakia was admitted to the league. But after only one season, Lev was replaced by a
                team of the same name, Lev Praha, from Prague, Czech Republic, while Slovan Bratislava from Bratislava,
                Slovakia and Ukraine's Donbass from Donetsk joined the KHL as expansion teams for the 2012–13
                season. Lev and Slovan qualified for the playoffs in their first KHL season.In 2013, Medveščak from
                Zagreb, Croatia, previously playing in the Austrian Hockey League, and Russian expansion team Admiral
                Vladivostok joined the league, thus expanding the league even further. The league comprised 28 teams
                during the 2013–14 season, of which 21 were based in Russia and 7 located in the other
                countries.<br><br>

                In 2014, Finnish team Jokerit from Helsinki, Lada Togliatti (which previously played in the league), and
                newly created team HC Sochi joined the league. However, HC Donbass did not play in the league for
                the 2014–15 season, due to the political instability in Ukraine, but had intended to rejoin later.
                Two other teams, Lev Praha and Spartak Moscow, also withdrew from the 2014–15 season due to financial
                problems.<br><br>

                Prior to the 2015–16 season, Atlant Moscow Oblast withdrew from the KHL due to financial issues, while
                Spartak Moscow returned after a one-year hiatus.<br><br>

                The newly created Chinese club HC Kunlun Red Star from Beijing was admitted for the 2016–17
                season.<br><br>

                Prior to the 2017–18 season, Medveščak Zagreb withdrew from the league to rejoin the Austrian league and
                Metallurg Novokuznetsk was sent down to the VHL.<br><br>

                Prior to the 2018–19 season, HC Slovan Bratislava withdrew from the KHL due to financial issues to
                rejoin the Slovak Tipsport Liga</p>
