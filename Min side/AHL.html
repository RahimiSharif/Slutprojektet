            <h2>American Hockey League</h2>
            <p>The American Hockey League (AHL) is a professional ice hockey league based in the United States and
                Canada that serves as the primary developmental league for the National Hockey League (NHL). Since
                the 2010–11 season, every team in the league has an affiliation agreement with one NHL team. When NHL
                teams do not have an AHL affiliate, players are assigned to AHL teams affiliated with other NHL teams.
                Twenty-seven AHL teams are located in the United States and the remaining four are in Canada. The league
                offices are located in Springfield, Massachusetts, and its current president is David Andrews.<br><br>

                In general, a player must be at least 18 years of age to play in the AHL or not currently be beholden to
                a junior ice hockey team. The league limits the number of experienced professional players on a team's
                active roster during any given game; only five skaters can have accumulated four full seasons of play or
                more at the professional level (goaltenders are exempt from this rule and can stay in the AHL
                indefinitely without being subject to this cap). The AHL allows for practice squad contracts.<br><br>

                The annual playoff champion is awarded the Calder Cup, named for Frank Calder, the first President
                (1917–1943) of the NHL. The reigning champions are the Toronto Marlies.The AHL traces its origins
                directly to two predecessor professional leagues: the Canadian-American Hockey League (the "Can-Am"
                League), founded in 1926, and the first International Hockey League, established in 1929. Although the
                Can-Am League never operated with more than six teams, the departure of the Boston Bruin Cubs after the
                1935–36 season reduced it down to just four member clubs – the Springfield Indians, Philadelphia
                Ramblers, Providence Reds, and New Haven Eagles – for the first time in its history. At the same time,
                the then-rival IHL lost half of its eight members after the 1935–36 season, also leaving it with just
                four member teams: the Buffalo Bisons, Syracuse Stars, Pittsburgh Hornets, and Cleveland
                Falcons.<br><br>

                With both leagues down to the bare minimum number of teams to be viable, the governors of both leagues
                recognized the need for action to assure their member clubs' long-term survival. Their solution was to
                play an interlocking schedule. While the Can-Am was based in the Northeast and the IHL in the Great
                Lakes, their footprints were close enough for this to be a viable option. The two leagues' eight
                surviving clubs began joint play in November 1936 as a new two-division "circuit of mutual convenience"
                known as the International-American Hockey League. The four Can-Am teams became the I-AHL East Division,
                with the IHL quartet playing as the West Division. The IHL also contributed its former championship
                trophy, the F. G. "Teddy" Oke Trophy, which would go to the regular-season winners of the merged
                league's West Division until 1952. The Oke Trophy is now awarded to the regular-season winners of the
                AHL's Northeast Division.<br><br>

                A little more than a month into that first season, the balance and symmetry of the new combined circuit
                suffered a setback when its membership unexpectedly fell to seven teams. The West's Buffalo Bisons were
                forced to cease operations on December 6, 1936, after playing just 11 games, because of what proved to
                be insurmountable financial problems and lack of access to a suitable arena; the Bisons' original arena,
                Peace Bridge Arena, had collapsed the previous season (a new Buffalo Bisons team would return to the
                league in 1940 after a new arena was constructed for them). The makeshift new I-AHL played out the rest
                of its first season (as well as all of the next) with just seven teams.<br><br>

                At the end of the 1936–37 season, a modified three-round playoff format was devised and a new
                championship trophy, the Calder Cup, was established. The Syracuse Stars defeated the Philadelphia
                Ramblers in the final, three-games-to-one, to win the first-ever Calder Cup championship. The Calder Cup
                continues on today as the AHL's playoff championship trophy.</p>
