            <h2>Swedish Hockey League</h2>
            <p>The Swedish Hockey League (SHL; Swedish: Svenska hockeyligan) is a professional ice hockey league, and
                the highest division in the Swedish ice hockey system. The league currently consists of 14 teams. The
                league was founded in 1975, and while Swedish ice hockey champions have been crowned through various
                formats since 1922, the title, as well as the Le Mat Trophy, have been awarded to the winner of the SHL
                playoffs since the league's inaugural 1975–76 season.<br><br>

                As of 2010–11, the SHL was the world's most evenly matched professional ice hockey league. During the
                2011–12 season, the SHL was the most well attended ice hockey league in Europe, averaging 6,385
                spectators per game, however in 2013–14, the SHL was third best in Europe, with an attendance average
                of 5,978. SHL was the second most popular sports team league within Sweden, after the football league
                Allsvenskan, which in the 2013 season had an average attendance of 7,627.<br><br>

                The league was founded in 1975 as Elitserien (in English often called the Swedish Elite League or
                SEL), and initially featured 10 teams, though this was expanded to 12 for the 1987–88 season. The
                league was renamed the SHL in 2013, and in 2014, a number of format changes were announced, including
                an expansion to 14 teams to be finalized prior to the 2015–16 season, and a new format for promotion
                from and relegation to HockeyAllsvenskan, the second tier league.The Swedish Ice Hockey Championship was
                awarded for the first time in 1922, only two years after ice hockey was introduced in Sweden by the
                American film director Raoul Le Mat. At this point, the Swedish Championships were held as a separate
                tournament. It was not until the 1952–53 season that the championship was awarded to the winner of the
                top-tier hockey league, which at the time was Division I.<br><br>

                The inaugural Elitserien season began on 5 October 1975, with the league consisting of 10 teams, each
                playing a regular season consisting of 36 games.[9] There has been extensive discussion about the number
                of teams in the SHL. The league has had 12 teams since an expansion from 10 teams in 1987, however,
                there has been general agreement among hockey experts that the league needs to be expanded by at least
                two more teams. (The second tier league HockeyAllsvenskan currently has 14 teams.) They mean that, apart
                from just the economic situation for some of the clubs, the competition from HockeyAllsvenskan has shown
                that more teams are needed in the top-tier league SHL. On 13 March 2014, the SHL and
                HockeyAllsvenskan announced that the SHL will be expanded to 14 teams, starting in the 2015–16 season.
                To make this change happen, at least two HockeyAllsvenskan teams will be promoted to the SHL in the
                2014–15 season.<br><br>

                In 2009, Håkan Loob, the general manager of Färjestad BK, sent a letter to Alexander Medvedev, the owner
                and president of the Russian Kontinental Hockey League, on behalf of five SHL teams – Färjestad,
                Frölunda, Djurgården, Linköping and HV71 – that were reportedly "interested in discussing the future of
                European hockey". It was believed that these five teams had intended to leave the SHL league after the
                2009–10 season; they terminated their shareholders' agreements with Hockeyligan, the name at that time
                for the SHL's governing body. The teams also formed an interest group to investigate the
                possibility of forming a continental hockey league spanning several European countries. These plans were
                abandoned in November 2011, however, with Frölunda's chairman expressing hopes for the future of the
                European Trophy (which was disbanded with the formation of the Champions Hockey League in 2013).<br><br>

                On 17 June 2013, the league was renamed "Svenska hockeyligan", since this would allow for an easy
                English translation ("Swedish Hockey League") and a common abbreviation between the two languages
                ("SHL"), all of which was considered to be a better brand identity to invest in</p>
